                <p>At the beginning, when creating the animation where "pf" and "global" gradually displayed similar to page information, the above information would often suddenly flash out. After many searches, I finally discovered that I needed to set the initial transparency to 0.</p>

                <h3>what i learned from process</h3>
                <p>To be honest, when I first decided to build a website, I had no idea what I was doing. Terms like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sounded super intimidating—like some secret code only tech geniuses could understand. I was a complete beginner and honestly wasn’t sure I’d be able to figure it out.

But I decided to give it a shot anyway. I started with super basic YouTube tutorials and the web corese work, followed some step-by-step guides online, and began messing around with code on sites like codepractise area. My first webpage was ridiculously simple—just some text on a colored background. Still, seeing something I made show up in a browser was really exciting.

Of course, there were tons of frustrating moments. My layout would break, random error messages popped up, and half the time I didn’t even know what I did wrong. I wanted to quit more than once. But every time I solved a small issue, it felt like a little victory. Slowly, I learned how to make menus, add images, and even make my site work on phones. Each step built up my confidence.

Eventually, I launched my first personal portfolio website. It wasn’t perfect, but it was mine—and it represented hours of hard work, trial and error, and learning.

Looking back, the most important thing I learned wasn’t just coding. It was patience, problem-solving, and not being afraid to start something new. The journey turned fear into curiosity. I may not be a pro yet, but I’m definitely on my way—and now, I’m excited to keep going.
